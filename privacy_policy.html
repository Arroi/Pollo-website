Temporary Data
Welcome & Leave Images
Póllo Boat creates the image from the user that is ether joining or leaving the server with the following data: [User Avatar, Username, User Discriminator, Server Name, Server Member Count].
Póllo Boat sends the image after generation to a private channel in a private server, accessible to the bot and the owner, and takes the media url and uses it in the welcome/leave embed. The bot doesn't delete these images sent in the private channel, if it were to, then the image in said welcome/leave embed would not show which would make this feature pointless.

Auto-Moderation
Póllo Boat does not store any message data nor cache it from this feature. Only matches the message with our lists of racial slurs, NSFW, and vulgar words, to see if the message needs to be filtered only if the feature is enabled.
